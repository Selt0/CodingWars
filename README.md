## :trophy: Daily Coding Challenges

This repository is just where I collect my daily coding challenge solutions.

### :thinking: Why?

I do daily challenges for a few reasons:
* Practice breaking down problems into smaller steps
* Daily practice = Repetition of core concepts
* Competition is a great motivator for me
